To create an executable of your current source code, run these commands in order:

  npx kill-port 3000
  npm run build-react
  npx electron-packager . "Your App Name" --platform=win32 --arch=x64 --out=dist --overwrite

  Explanation:
  1. npx kill-port 3000 - Clears the development port (as per your CLAUDE.local.md requirement)
  2. npm run build-react - Builds your current React source code into the build/ folder
  3. npx electron-packager . "Your App Name" --platform=win32 --arch=x64 --out=dist --overwrite - Creates the       
  executable

  Key points:
  - Always run npm run build-react first to ensure the build folder has your latest changes
  - Replace "Your App Name" with whatever you want the executable to be called
  - The executable will be created in dist/Your App Name-win32-x64/Your App Name.exe
  - --overwrite ensures it replaces any existing build

  Optional: If you want to clean previous builds first:
  rm -rf build dist
