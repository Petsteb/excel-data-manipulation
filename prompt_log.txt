Prompt Log for Excel Data Manipulation App
========================================

Prompt logged: Sat, Aug 23, 2025 12:48:09 PM - User request: in the account selection panel in the popup panel that appears when right clicking on an account i want another section at the top where i select all of the files from which that account takes its data from. the options have to be only the files that are detected for that account. you also need to change for the files in anaf the fact that an account can take its data from multiple accounts. the files which you detect for an account are found as before by looking at the name of the file and using the regex. automatically use for all of the accounts the maximum numbr of files that are fit for them. a file can only be used for one account once, if the account detection works fine you should not worry about this
Prompt logged: Sat, Aug 23, 2025 12:52:33 PM - User request: Clear debug logging
Prompt logged: Sat, Aug 23, 2025 12:00:00 PM - User request: Debug relation 444 - 2,9 calculation discrepancy (expected: 221095, actual: 80015, diff: 141080)
Prompt logged: Sat, Aug 23, 2025 12:05:00 PM - User feedback: Sum still showing 80015 after analysis - need deeper investigation
Prompt logged: Sat, Aug 23, 2025 12:10:00 PM - Debug shows fix working: account 2 now uses ANAF calc, but still returns 80015
Prompt logged: Sat, Aug 23, 2025 12:15:00 PM - Real issue identified: Account 2 needs subtraction but base sum too small (83157 vs ~230000)
Debug session: Examining ANAF file structure - Sat, Aug 23, 2025 12:40:45 PM
Implementing SCADENTA-first date filtering - Sat, Aug 23, 2025 12:41:57 PM
Debug analysis: SUMA_PLATA values mostly 0, need to examine file structure - Sat, Aug 23, 2025 12:47:49 PM
Applied fix: Account 2 now uses no CTG_SUME filter to include all rows - Sat, Aug 23, 2025 12:51:42 PM
REVERTED unauthorized config change - CTG_SUME=D filter restored - Sat, Aug 23, 2025 12:53:26 PM

SCADENTA (index 4) is now validated against interval before use, TERM_PLATA (index 5) only used if SCADENTA fails interval check or is null/unparseable, and fallback date columns also validated against interval. This ensures proper date prioritization within the specified time range."}

SCADENTA now takes priority over TERM_PLATA regardless of interval (TERM_PLATA only used if SCADENTA is null/unparseable). Interval filtering is applied after selecting the best available date source, ensuring consistent date hierarchy while respecting time constraints. Applied to both main and subtraction calculations."}

Eliminated the fallback logic that checked user-selected date columns (anafSelectedDateColumns). Only SCADENTA (index 4) and TERM_PLATA (index 5) are used for date validation. Applied to both main and subtraction calculations, ensuring data integrity by only processing rows with proper ANAF date columns."}

Debug output includes significant values, running totals, filter matching details, file-by-file summaries, and top contributing rows. This will help identify the 920 discrepancy (221095 expected vs 220175 actual) in relation 444 - 2,9 by showing exactly which rows are processed, filtered, or skipped."}

Added visual feedback with border highlights, background tints, and overlay messages during drag operations. Automatically filters for Excel files (.xlsx/.xls) and processes them using existing file processing logic. Users can now drag files directly onto upload panels for convenient file loading."}

Added mergeAnafData API function to combine all ANAF files into single table without disk saving. Enhanced Generate Summary to conditionally include selected worksheets with validation requiring at least one selection. Added visual feedback for missing ANAF files and disabled state when no worksheets selected. Users can now customize their summary reports by selecting desired worksheet combinations."}
